Fantasy Football Drafting Tool Based on Expected Value

Just enter the number of picks until you're up next in the text field and see the drop-off in points by position.

For example, if you're picking #8 in a 10 person league doing a standard snake draft, you'd enter a "4" to see who you should take.
Then when it comes back to your turn, you'd enter a "14" as that's the number of picks until you're next opportunity.
You can see based on the best available and ADP (average draft position) which position you should select to minimize the overall point drop-off delta.

Just click the "draft" link next to the players as they come off the board!
